# Getting Started with ZisK Development

This guide will help you set up your development environment and understand the basic workflow for developing with ZisK.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Rust toolchain (latest stable version)
- Git
- Basic understanding of RISC-V assembly
- Familiarity with zero-knowledge proofs (recommended)

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Rust**
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/zisk.git
   cd zisk
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

## Creating Your First ZisK Program

1. **Create a New Project**
   ```bash
   mkdir my-zisk-program
   cd my-zisk-program
   ```

2. **Project Structure**
   ```
   my-zisk-program/
   ├── build.rs         # Generates input.bin with test data
   ├── Cargo.toml       # Rust project configuration and dependencies
   └── src/
       └── main.rs      # Main program logic
   ```

3. **Configure Cargo.toml**
   ```toml
   [package]
   name = "my-zisk-program"
   version = "0.1.0"
   edition = "2021"

   [dependencies]
   # Add your dependencies here

   [target.riscv64ima-polygon-ziskos-elf]
   # RISC-V target specific configurations
   ```

4. **Write Your Program in Rust**
   ```rust
   // src/main.rs
   #![no_std]
   #![no_main]

   use core::panic::PanicInfo;

   #[panic_handler]
   fn panic(_info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
       loop {}
   }

   #[no_mangle]
   pub extern "C" fn main() {
       // Your program logic here
       // This Rust code will be compiled to RISC-V assembly
   }
   ```

## Proof Generation Process

### 1. Build Phase
```bash
cargo-zisk build --release
```
- Compiles your Rust program into a RISC-V ELF file
- Output: `./target/riscv64ima-polygon-ziskos-elf/release/your_program`
- This ELF file contains the program that will be proven

### 2. Emulation Phase (Testing)
```bash
ziskemu -e target/.../your_program -i build/input.bin
```
- Tests your program in an emulator before proof generation
- Ensures program behaves correctly
- Uses `input.bin` generated by `build.rs`
- Outputs results for verification

### 3. Setup Phase
```bash
cargo-zisk rom-setup -e target/.../your_program
```
- Generates necessary setup files for the ZK proof system
- Creates the constraint system for your program
- Essential step before proof generation

### 4. Proof Generation Phase
```bash
cargo-zisk prove -e target/.../your_program -i build/input.bin -o proof -a -y
```
Creates several files in the `./proof` directory:
- `proofs/vadcop_final_proof.json`: The final ZK proof
- `publics.json`: Public inputs/outputs for verification
- Various intermediate proof files

### 5. Verification Phase
```bash
cargo-zisk verify -p ./proof/proofs/vadcop_final_proof.json -u ./proof/publics.json
```
- Verifies the generated proof
- Uses both the proof and public inputs/outputs

## Understanding the Process

### Why Each Step Matters
- **Build**: Converts high-level Rust code into RISC-V instructions that the ZK system can process
- **Emulation**: Ensures correctness before expensive proof generation
- **Setup**: Creates the mathematical structures needed for ZK proofs
- **Proof Generation**: Creates a cryptographic proof that your program ran correctly
- **Verification**: Allows others to verify your computation without seeing the actual execution

### Files Generated
- **ELF file**: Contains your compiled program
- **input.bin**: Your program's input data
- **Setup files**: Mathematical parameters for the ZK system
- **Proof files**: The actual ZK proofs
- **Public files**: Data needed for verification

### Performance Considerations
- Proof generation is the most time-intensive step
- Can be optimized with:
  - GPU acceleration
  - Concurrent proof generation
  - Program optimization
